# Astro_98_Final-Project
This is my final project for the Python Decal 2024 course

My project was to use a data set of galaxy candidates and other object and, along with downloading images of these galaxies, I used the mass and distance of a small set of galaxies in a graph in order to determine if they had any correlation.

# Astro_98_Final-Project
This is my final project for the Python Decal 2024 course

My project was to use a data set of galaxy candidates and other object and, along with downloading images of these galaxies, I used the mass and distance of a small set of galaxies in a graph in order to determine if they had any correlation.

The attached fits files are the files used to image each galaxy in my dataset, and the original fits file that I used 'nsa_v0_1_2.fits' was too large to upload to this repository.

All of my code is in the file 'final_project_main.ipynb' which needs to be downloaded to be viewed.
